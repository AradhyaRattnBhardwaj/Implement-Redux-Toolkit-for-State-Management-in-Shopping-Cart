## 📂 File Structure

```
src/
├── store.js          # Custom Redux-like store and cart reducer

```

## 💡 Explanation

This app mimics Redux functionality **without any external dependencies**.  
It uses a global store created via `createStore()` with manual `subscribe()` to React state updates.

**Key Functions:**
- `createStore()` – Initializes store and state
- `dispatch()` – Updates state via reducer
- `subscribe()` – Triggers re-renders on change
- `cartReducer()` – Handles all cart operations
